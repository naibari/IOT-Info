# The Internet of Things (IoT)
Describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) that are embedded with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies, and that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.



## Below are some examples of how IoT impacts our daily lives

### 1. Home Security
The Internet of Things is the key driver behind a completely smart and secure home. IoT connects a variety of sensors, alarms, cameras, lights, and microphones to provide 24/7/365 securityâ€”all of which can be controlled from a smart phone. For example, the Ring doorbell camera security system allows users to see, hear, and speak to visitors at their door via a computer, tablet, or mobile phone.

### 2. Activity Trackers
These sensor devices are designed to be worn during the day to monitor and transmit key health indicators in real time, such as fatigue, appetite, physical movement, oxygen levels, blood pressure, fall detection, and compliance with taking medicine. At-home health monitoring reduces the number of emergency doctor or hospital visits and helps elderly or disabled people live more independent lives.

### 3. Digital Twins
In the manufacturing world, a digital twin is essentially an identical digital copy of a physical object. Using technologies including IoT, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, the digital twin can update itself as the physical object changes in response to its surrounding conditions. Engineers can use the digital twin, instead of the actual physical object, to make adjustments or test updates. 

### 4. Self-Healing Machines
Relying on arrays of thousands of sensors, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, manufacturing equipment can be designed to recognize variances in its own operation, and correct them, before they turn into problems that require downtime and repair. This saves companies time and money and frees up employees who would normally monitor equipment and undertake maintenance to work on higher-level tasks.

### 5. Motion Detection
Using sensors to detect motion or vibration in large-scale structures such as buildings, bridges, and dams can identify the small disturbances and patterns that could lead to catastrophic failures. Networks of detectors are also used in areas susceptible to landslides, avalanches, and earthquakes.
